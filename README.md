## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Hello! I make stuff(sometimes)

### Reaching out to me ðŸ“«:
I'm always willing to talk about my work and maybe(If I have time) work on a project with someone if my skills apply
- Twitter("X"): account is linked

### My Experience ðŸ¤“:
I have over a year of experience creating VR apps and I also have experience in teaching people how to code! This means that I learned the hard way on how to work in a team and talk to people. This GitHub is pretty empty since my professional one has the cool stuff to help me get a job. This is just here for tomfoolery

### Programming Languages and frameworks:
- JavaScript(I hate it but I seem to work the most in it) for web development and RpgMaker MV
  - Svelte(The only good JS frontend framework)
  - Vue(Not bad)
  - React(trash)
  - Express for backend stuff
- C#(Unity)
- GdScript(Godot)
- Python for machine learning and some backend stuff
- HTML/CSS
- Nim(The love of my life)
- Zig(My love affair, don't tell Nim)
- C/C++ when I feel insane
- Rust
