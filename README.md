### Reaching out to me ðŸ“«:
I'm always willing to talk about my work and maybe(If I have time) work on a project with someone if my skills apply

### My Experience ðŸ¤“:
I have over a year of experience creating VR apps and I also have experience in teaching people how to code! This means that I learned the hardway on how to work in a team and talk to people.
